## Data Source

Our data includes financial information on companies in the S&P 500 stock index from 1999-2021. This information was scraped from Yahoo Finance in November of 2021, and collected in a csv format for data analysis.

To collect the data, first, we got the list of the current 500 S&P companies from Slickchart (https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500). After having the list of the companies, we then moved on to the financial information of the listed companies on yahoo finance (https://finance.yahoo.com/) to get the metrics such as sales, earnings, cogs, stock price, and market sector. We then scraped the data using the BeautifulSoup library in Python and turned that into a CSV file. 

Our main goal is to analyze and model this data to better improve projections for a companyâ€™s future metrics, like earnings.
